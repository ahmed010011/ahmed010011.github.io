            Egypt is the cradle of human civilization, where its civilization contributed to the making of the history
            and beliefs of mankind prominently, as it possesses a vast wealth of archaeological sites and monuments and
            cultural monuments important to the whole world, apart from its economic importance as a source of great
            income for the state, in addition to providing many career opportunities, and it is worth mentioning that
            Egypt includes one third of the archaeological sites that display the culture and history of the peoples of
            the world, Archaeological sites range from Pharaonic, Greek, Roman, Coptic and Islamic sites.

    <h1>Temple of Abu Simbel</h1>
    <p class="b">
        The Great Temple of Abu Simbel, located in Nubia near egypt's southern border, is one of the most magnificent
        monuments in Egypt, king Ramses II of the nineteenth dynasty was completely cut in the mountain, around 1264 BC,
        the temple is famous for its four huge statues sitting on its façade, one of which collapsed due to an ancient
        earthquake and its remains are still on the ground.

            The king's huge statues stand on both sides of the main hall leading to The Holy Mass, where four gods sit:
            Amon Ra, Ra'ah Rahtti, Petah, and Ramses II. The temple was built with high accuracy so that the sunshine in
            the temple enters two days a year, on February 22 and October 22, crosses the main hall, illuminates the
            statues deep inside the temple, and these dates are believed to correspond to the coronation and birth of
            Ramses II.

            The two temples were relocated from their original site in 1968 after the construction of the Aswan High
            Dam, which threatened to flood them. The transfer was completed thanks to unesco-led international efforts.
            The temple was accepted on the World Heritage Site list in 1977 by the Great Property of Ramses II, Queen
            Nefertari. On the façade of the small temple, its huge statues stand the same size as her husband's, in a
            very rare example.

    <h1>Valley of the Kings</h1>
    <div class="Aa">
        <p>
            The kings of the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties of the modern state (circa 1550-1069 B.C.) were buried in a
            dry river valley on the west bank of the ancient city of Taiba (modern Luxor), hence its name, wadi
            al-Kings, but this name is not entirely accurate since some members of the royal family other than kings
            were buried there, as well as some non-royal individuals,

            The car is the fastest crossover in the world and the strongest, as the car can pull the weight of 3 tons
            without any problems because of the terrible power that gives it this puzzling

            The car comes with multiple propulsion systems but these systems not only affect the engine, suspension and
            transmission, but the propulsion system varies according to each system, we find that when walking normally
            the force is divided by half between the wheels

            This site was carefully chosen to bury the kings, located on the West Bank of the Nile, because the god of
            the sun descends (die) on the western horizon in order to be reborn, and rejuvenate on the eastern horizon,
            which is why the West was associated with funerary concepts and the ancient Egyptian tombs were generally
            located on the west bank of the Nile river for this insult

            The mighty kings of the modern state were buried beneath the top of a pyramidal cliff surrounding the
            valley. The choice of the valley to carve the royal tombs was not a coincidence, the pyramid was a symbol of
            resurrection and eternal life, as the hierarchy was considered a sign of the gods, this area and the summit
            itself, under the control of The Hoor

            The secluded nature of this valley was another reason for its choice as the last resting place for kings,
            the tombs were stolen in antiquity, and to avoid that fate, as happened to the pyramids of the ancient and
            central state, they chose hidden underground tombs in a secluded desert valley. The first rulers of the
            modern state confirmed to be buried in the Valley of the Kings was Thutmose I (circa 1504−92 B.C.) the third
            king of the eighteenth dynasty, according to Ini, chief excavation officer of his tomb: "I supervised the
            excavation of his tomb [the king] in privacy, no one sees and no one names

        Philae Temple
    </h1>
    <div class="Dd">
        <p>
            Philae's monuments include many buildings dating back to the Ptolemaic period (332-30 B.C.) Most notably,
            the temple started by Ptolemy II Villadelvos (285-246 B.C.) Dedicated to Isis, the mother of Horus, the lord
            of the monarchy, there is a view in the Mamezi or the delivery room, where the birth of Horus was
            celebrated, showing Isis nursing her son Horus in the bushes.

            The Temple of Isis is one of the most persistent ancient Egyptian temples, where the temple continued to
            play its role until the reign of Byzantine King Justinian (527-565 AD), which ordered the closure of all
            pagan temples, where a priest named Asmit-Akham engraved the last Hieroglyphics text from the 4th century AD
            (394 AD). The temple was converted into a Christian church and many of the inscriptions of the cube were
            destroyed.
