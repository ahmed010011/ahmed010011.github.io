     <dl>  <dt><h2>Fez Bali</h2></dt>
        <dd><P>
        Fez al-Bali was founded in the 9th century by the Adars before hundreds of Muslim and Jewish families 
        fleeing Andalusia settled on the right bank of the Fez Valley and then By Kiruania families on the other bank. 
During the Almohad era, Jews and Muslims who did not believe in mahdi ibn Toumert's doctrine suffered from harassment 
and abuse. The walls surrounding Fez al-Bali date back to the reign of Muhammad al-Nasser al-Muhadidi, but the doors they 
penetrate bear names dating back to the rule of the Adassa and Zinatians, such as Bab al-Fotouh and Bab al-Kisa. Construction
 of Jewish neighbourhoods began during the Marinid era, most notably the new Fez navigator outside the walls of Fez al-Bali.

  <dl><dt><h2>Marrakech</h2></dt>
  <dd> <p>
        The Marrakesh region was inhabited by Neolithic Amazigh farmers, and many stone tools were discovered in 
        the area. [18] Marrakesh was founded in 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar) by Abu Bakr bin Omar al-Lamatouni,
         leader and cousin of The Almoravid Sultan Yusuf bin Tashfeen (1061−1106). [19] [20] [21] During the Amazigh
          dynasty of the Merabets, many Mosques and Islamic schools (Qur'anic schools) were built, developing society
           into a commercial center for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. [14] Marrakech grew rapidly and established
            as a cultural and religious center, replacing Agmat, long the capital of the Hawz region. Andalusian artisans
             from Córdoba and Seville built and decorated many of the city's palaces, developing the Umayyad style, which
              features carved domes and engraved arches. [14] [22] This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the
              Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique style of architecture that was fully adapted to the Marrakech environment. 
              Youssef ben Tashfeen completed the city's first mosque (ibn Yusuf Mosque, named after him), built houses, minted coins,
               and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans. [14] The city became the capital of the Almoravid state,[23]
                stretching from senegal's shores to central Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers.

          517,000, according to the 2014 census. [2] The state of Meknes spans an area of 1,786 square kilometers and
           is located between two mountainous spaces: the beginnings of the countryside in its north and the Mediterranean
            Atlas in the south. [1] Meknes province is divided into two workers: Menzah and Ismailia, and comprises 21
             groups, including 15 village groups. The city of Meknes is located at the crossroads of road and rail hubs,
              linking Rabat, Quneitra and Oujda on the one hand, and Tangier and Marrakech on the other,[1] making it historically
               a transit and stability area since ancient times. [3] It has gained considerable strategic importance to successive 
               countries over Morocco's rule.</dd> </dl>

        The new old city of Mazagan, which includes Portuguese Mazagan and parts of an ancient Moroccan architecture in blends and 
        coordination, has added to the site charm and character, since the end of the Middle Ages after the fall of Andalusia and the 
        beginning of the great eras of exploration, so it is also called the Portuguese city of Mazagan or Mazagan al-Jadida, registered
         in 2004,[1] is a unesco World Heritage List.
        It is one of the first centres fortified and settled by the Portuguese 
        from the gateway to Africa to the depths on their way to India. These effects are clearly reflected in engineering and urban 
        planning. 
        Mazagan is also a prime example of the fortified Portuguese cities through which Renaissance ideas and Portuguese architecture
         techniques that led the first phase of European cruises and Aruba explorations of the New World take shape.

         file was submitted under the title: "Rabat, the modern capital and the historic city: a common heritage",
          the first founding date of Rabat, the capital of the Kingdom of Morocco, dates back to the Almoravids who
           established a fortified bond, as the obsession with security was the strongest factor behind this choice
            to be the strongest factor behind this choice. A point for the mujahedeen to gather and respond to the Paraguay attacks.

The Shala site in Rabat remained abandoned from the 5th to the 10th century AD, turning the site into a bond in
which the mujahedeen gathered to confront the Barghawata tribe. However, this historical phase remains unclear
 until the Marinian Sultan Abu Yusuf Yaacoub took from the site in 1284 a cemetery to bury the kings and dignitaries
  of Bani Marin, where the first nucleus of a complex that included a mosque, a house of ablution and a dome where
   his wife Um al-Ezz was buried.
