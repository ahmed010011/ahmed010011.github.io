     to the Syrian-Jordanian border in the far north of Jordan. The black volcanic city. The city was built on the edge of one of the
      valleys that descend from Jabal al-Druze towards the southwest. This valley is a separating boundary between the Syrian Hurra, 
      which extends from Azraq in the south to the outskirts of Damascus and from Wadi Makat in the east to Umm al-Jimal in the west,
       with a depth of more than 200 km. This city was built on the edge of the valley in order to provide it with water as a basic
       factor for stability, as there are dozens of ponds, water tanks and wells dug on the edges of the valley, some of which are still usable today.

      due to the colors of its twisted rocks. Petra was founded approximately in 312 BC as the capital of the Nabataean kingdom.[4] It assumed a
       prominent position for many years, as its location on the Silk Road, the Mediterranean for the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Palestine and
        Egypt, played a major role that made the Nabataean state control the trade between the civilizations of these regions and their inhabitants.

    The Baptism is the place where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist according to Christian beliefs. Bethany, where John the Baptist
     preached and baptized in the first period of his gospel. This information has been revealed following the archaeological excavations 
     that have been carried out along the "Wadi Al-Kharar" since 1996. The evidence contained in the biblical text, the writings of Byzantine
      historians and medieval historians, as well as the archaeological excavations carried out recently, show that the site where John the 
      Baptist was It preaches and baptizes, including the adoption of Jesus Christ by John the Baptist, located east of the Jordan River in the
       land known today as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The Gospel of John (1:28) talks about “Bethany across the Jordan, where John the 
       Baptist was baptizing,” and here refers to the phrase “across the Jordan” to the east bank of the river. In a later reference to the same
        site on the east bank, the Gospel of John (10:40) says that Jesus Christ also traveled through the Jordan where John the Baptist had initially
         been baptizing and went again to the same place and resided there. During the last excavations that took place in Jordan in 1997, a series of
          ancient sites were found related to the site where John the Baptist was baptized and where Jesus Christ was baptized. This series of sites is
           located along Wadi al-Kharar, east of the Jordan River. A Byzantine monastery was discovered at the site of Tell al-Kharar, referred to as 
           "Bethany across the Jordan." This site is located about two kilometers (2.1 miles) east of the Jordan River at the beginning of Wadi al-Kharar.
            There are several natural springs that form pools from which water begins to flow into Wadi al-Kharar, and eventually flows into the Jordan River.
             As well as a pastoral oasis located at the beginning of Wadi Al-Kharar and the site of Tell Al-Kharar.

    Al-Khazneh is an ancient rock-cut building dating back to the Nabatean civilization in Jordan. It is located in the archaeological reserve in the city
     of Petra in the south of the country. Al-Khazneh is the most famous and important landmark of the city. The Nabataeans carefully chose its location as
      the first landmark that the visitor encounters after entering the city. It was given this name because the local Bedouins previously believed that the
       urn at the top of the facade contained a treasure, but it was actually a royal tomb.
