    <h1>Tourism in Australia</h1>
    <p>
      Tourism in Australia is an important part of the Australian economy, and
      comprises domestic and international visitors.<br />
      In the financial year 2018/19, tourism was Australia's fourth-largest
      export and over the previous decade was growing faster than national GDP
      growth.<br />
      At the time it represented 3.1% of Australia's GDP contributing A$60.8
      billion to the national economy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Popular Australian destinations include the coastal cities of Sydney,
      Brisbane and Melbourne,<br />
      as well as other high-profile destinations including regional Queensland,
      the Gold Coast and the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef.<br />
      Uluru and the Australian outback are other popular locations, as is the
      Tasmanian wilderness.<br />
      The unique Australian wildlife is also another significant point of
      interest in the country's tourism.
